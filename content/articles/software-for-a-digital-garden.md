I might finally be able to make a digital garden with a self hosted version of [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). Since the goal of this site was originally to be "un-posse" and just kind of exist on the internet, and I wanted it to be a collection of cool ideas, notes, inspiration, etc, I might switch it from bear blog to self hosted. Let's see how I feel this week. 

For now, I've switched back to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for my offline digital notebook. I'm really sick of seeing Notion enable more features I don't need and marketing their AI features. I am trying out Obsidian Sync since I need to be able to access my notes on my phone, Mac, PC and Linux (when I'm tinkering), but really like that Obsidian keeps markdown files locally. I might also try the [Obsidian-webpage-export](https://github.com/KosmosisDire/obsidian-webpage-export/) plugin to see how I like using that for a site.
