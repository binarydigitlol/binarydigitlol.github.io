What is the IndieWeb?

As per [indieweb.org](https://indieweb.org/)

> The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the “corporate web”.
We are a community of independent and personal websites based on the principles of: owning your domain and using it as your primary online identity, publishing on your own site first (optionally elsewhere), and owning your content. 

On my other personal website, I do POSSE, since I want to get more exposure to my website where I talk about gaming, art, live streaming, and connect with a different pseudonym. 

On this website, I mentioned in an [earlier post](/un-posse-an-experiment/), that I want to publish here and not really syndicate elsewhere as an experiment on keeping a presence on a blog without social media. It's a bit simpler and I can just focus on writing articles about the indie web, small web, design, creativity, health, and hopefully create a portfolio where I keep more of a professional presence. 

Regarding the IndieWeb, it's bringing yourself back to the early days of the internet. We only had websites then; no social media. We had a personal domain, forums, IRC, chat rooms, and other simpler ways to be online when we chose to be, and not always available. I miss those days often. But we need to remember, we can still do that if we set boundaries. There are tons of folks that I've found on forums, discovery feeds, and via my own RSS reader linked from other sites, where people have decided to quit social media and take back their attention to writing, and their content.

Are you ready to join the IndieWeb? I'd love to [hear from you](/contact/)!
