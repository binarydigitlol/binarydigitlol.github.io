title: About
---
I go by the name Liz Roboto - some people know me as B online. I was born in New York City and grew up on Long Island. I went to college to get my bachelors in Computer Science and find my way into a career of tech support, product training, systems engineering, and web development.

In 2017 I quit my tech job due to major burn out then took a full time full stack web developer bootcamp to pivot to become a software engineer. In 2021 I took a part time game development course via Code Coven to learn the foundations of Epic’s Unreal Engine and really enjoyed learning game making and design. Today I’m a technical director for a media brand in the health and wellness space and live with my partner and two husky lab twin dogs in Michigan.

In my spare time I like to practice art, coding, writing, mixing music, live streaming and creating an online community of creatives, gamers, developers, and various professionals to create an inclusive, safe space for folks of all ages and backgrounds. Now I'm on a journey to get back to my healthiest self and work on fun projects.
